# JOSE'S TORTAS MEXICO MERN STACK APP

## _TORTAS MEXICO APP, MERN STACK_

## _MongoDB, Express, React JS, Node JS_

TORTAS MEXICO APP is a full-stack application using the MERN STACK.
I have slowly been testing out ideas and discussing them with Tortas Mexico.
I am now ready to create a full-stack application that will help this small business
with their online appearance. The goal of this application is to replace an outdated
looking website they currently have. Although customers may already have become
familiar with the current website URL, my goal is to slowly transition them into
navigating to this revamped website build. I have discussed details with the owner and
they are happy to hear I will be creating a modern looking website that will use stripe
payments in order to place orders for catering online which will be a brand new
feature they are excited to launch with me as their web developer. Eventually,
this website will also be used alongside the Doordash API to have a cleaner
online delivery ordering experience.

## Features

- Display Engaging Landing Page
- Render Menu Items from backend
- Use JWT to handle Authentication
